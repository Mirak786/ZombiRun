# ZombiRun
ZombiRun was developed by my team at OMG Studios (Run by Saqib Munir, Hassan Ali, SÅ‚awek Chmielewski and Myself)
The game was on Google PlayStore and Apple's AppStore for a year and had a couple of hundred downloads.
It is a side scrolling game in which the player taps the screen to make Zombi jump over obstacles while being chased by an angry mob hunting down the last (un)living zombie.
It features Facebook intregration which allow you to post highscores and invite friends to play. It also has GooglePlay HighScores for you to compete with others.
